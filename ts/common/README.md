[Barcode Bakery](https://www.barcodebakery.com) is a library written in TypeScript, [.NET Standard](https://github.com/barcode-bakery/barcode-dotnet-1d/) and [PHP](https://github.com/barcode-bakery/barcode-php-1d/) which allows you to generate barcodes on the fly on your server for displaying or saving or directly on the client.

This is the common base for generating all barcode types.
